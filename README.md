Week 1- Assignment 



In this assignment, I edited the html document. I simplfied and organized the lines of code for accessibility.

2. I replaced the div tags with HTML Semantic Tags.

3. I condensed the CSS style sheet by putting elements with the same style effects on the same line.

4. I added 'alt' tags on all of the images for accessibility purposes. 

5. I checked the site's URL to ensure that it resembled the demo page given.
